// Notes:

// This code defines a functional React component named Control.
// Functional components in React are simple JavaScript functions that return JSX, describing the structure of the component's UI.
// The Control component takes a single parameter, props, which is an object containing properties passed to this component when it's used elsewhere in your application.
// Inside the component's JSX, there is a div element with the class name "Control." This is the outer container for the control component.
// Inside the "Control" div, there's another div element with the class name "Control-button." This inner div represents a button or control element within the "Control" container.
// The onClick attribute is set to props.button, which means that when this inner div is clicked, it will execute the function passed in as the "button" prop.
// The button prop is expected to be a function defined in the parent component that uses this Control component. This function typically handles some action or behavior associated with the control element.
// Finally, the Control component is exported as the default export of the module, making it available for use in other parts of your application.
// In summary, this code defines a reusable React component named Control that represents a control element with a click event handler. This component can be customized by passing a function as the "button" prop to define what happens when the control is clicked.
